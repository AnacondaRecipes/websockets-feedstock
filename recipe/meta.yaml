  summary: 'A library for developing WebSocket servers and clients in Python.'
  description: |
    websockets is a library for developing WebSocket servers and clients in
    Python. It implements RFC 6455 with a focus on correctness and simplicity.
    It passes the Autobahn Testsuite. Built on top of asyncio, Python's
    standard asynchronous I/O framework, it provides a straightforward API
    based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly concurrent
    applications.
